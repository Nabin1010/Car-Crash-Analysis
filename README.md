# Car Crash Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains the files and resources for the Car Crash Analysis project completed during a virtual internship provided by Mentorness. The main objective of this project was to analyze car crash data and create a Power BI dashboard for visualization and insights.

## Contents
- **Datasets:**
  - *Traffic_Crashes.csv:* Raw data containing information about car crashes.
  - *Problem Statement.pdf:* A document describing the problem statement and requirements of the project.
- **Power BI Dashboard:** The Power BI dashboard file (*.pbix*) is located here. It includes various visualizations and insights derived from the analysis of the crash data.
- **Car_Crash_Analysis_PPT:** This folder contains the PowerPoint presentation of the project.

## Usage
To utilize the Power BI dashboard and explore the insights:
1. Ensure you have Power BI Desktop installed on your system.
2. Open the *Car_Crash_Analysis.pbix* file using Power BI Desktop.
3. Interact with the different visualizations to explore the data and gain insights into car crash patterns and trends.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to express our gratitude to Mentorness for providing the opportunity to work on this project and gain valuable insights into data analysis and visualization techniques.
